### 🔑 Guidelines

Welcome to this repository if you are here as an open-source program participant/contributor.

Participants/contributors have to comment on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA will assign you. Issues will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Participants/contributors can also open their issues using the issue_template, but it needs to be verified and labeled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether it is an Issue or a Pull Request.

When you raise an issue, make sure you get it assigned to you before you start working on that project.

Each participant/contributor will be assigned one issue (max) at a time to work.

Participants are expected to follow project guidelines and coding style. Structured code is one of our top priorities.

Try to explain your approach to solve any issue in the comments. This will increase the chances of you being assigned.

Don't create issues that are already listed.

Please don't pick up an issue already assigned to someone else. Work on the issues after it gets assigned to you.

Make sure you discuss issues before working on the issue.

Pull requests will be merged after being reviewed by a mentor or PA.

It might take a day or two to review your pull request. Please have patience and be nice.

Always create a pull request from a branch other than main.

Participants/contributors have to complete issues before the decided Deadline. If you fail to make a PR within the deadline, then the issue will be assigned to another person in the queue.

While making PRs, don't forget to add a description of your work.

Include the issue number (Fixes: issue number) in your commit message while creating a pull request.

Make sure your solution to any issue is better in terms of performance and other parameters compared to the previous work.

We all are here to learn. You are allowed to make mistakes. That's how you learn, right!.

### 📝 Project Structure for Issues
